*Figure: Mean direction and intensity of methane flux for months (left) and diurnal phases (right). Arrow direction indicates the average direction of flux, while its thickness represents the dispersion (1-rho). Thin arrows represent a concentration of directiton of measurement. Arrow length represents the average flux intensity (FCH4) for each period. The density of measurements are plotted as backgroud greyscale.*
