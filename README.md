*Figure: Mean direction and intensity of methane flux for months (left) and diurnal phases (right). The direction of arrows indicates the mean direction of flux for that period, while its the arrow thickness represents the dispersion (1-rho) around that mean (only the ranking). A narrow  arrowline signifies a narrow spread in the direction of measurement. The length of each arrow represents the average flux intensity (FCH4 not-gapfilled) for each period. The density of individual flux measurements is plotted as isopolygons ranging from dark grey for higher density of measurements.*
